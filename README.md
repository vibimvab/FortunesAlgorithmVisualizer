Fortune's algorithm visualizer implemented with tkinter

**Time complexity of the algorithm**: O(n^2), had the beach line tree is self-balancing, it would be O(n*log(n)).

**Time complexity of visualization**: Average case O(k + n), worst case O(k + n*log(n)). k for the number of rays being drawn.

**Space complexity**: O(n)
